This section covers two main topics:
(i). Conditional Statements: How to make your program make decisions (if, switch).
(ii). Exception Handling: How to deal with errors gracefully (try...catch).

1. Block Statements ({ }) and Scope

Purpose: A block statement is a pair of curly braces { } used to group zero or more JavaScript statements.

Usage: You'll use them constantly with if, else, switch, for, while, etc., to define what code should be run for that condition or loop.

The var "Gotcha": As the note points out, variables declared with var are not block-scoped. They are function-scoped (or global). This means they "leak out" of the block.

Modern Practice: This "leaking" behavior is confusing. That's why let and const were introduced. They are block-scoped, meaning they only exist inside the { } they are defined in. You should almost always prefer let and const.

What is Control Flow?

Control flow determines how your code executes, step by step.
It allows you to make decisions, repeat actions, and handle errors instead of running linearly from top to bottom.
===========================================================================================================================
i. if / else statement

- Used for decision making.
- Executes one block if a condition is true, another if false.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. switch statement

Used to execute different code blocks based on specific values of a variable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iii. for loop

Repeats a block of code a fixed number of times.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iv. while loop

Repeats as long as the condition is true.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v. do...while loop

Runs at least once, even if the condition is false.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vi. break and continue

- break → exits a loop or switch entirely.

- continue → skips current iteration, continues with the next one.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vii. for...in

Used to loop through object properties.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
viii. for...of

Used to loop through arrays or strings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ix. labelled statement (rarely used)

Labels allow you to name a loop and break or continue that specific loop.

Error Handling

- Sometimes our code may break (for example, dividing by zero or using undefined variables).
- Error Handling helps you catch errors gracefully instead of crashing the program.

i. try...catch

Sometimes our JavaScript program runs into an error (for example, dividing by zero, using undefined variables, or invalid user input).
If not handled, the program stops running — and you don’t want that.

To prevent that, we use try...catch — it lets us “try” some code and “catch” errors if they occur.

flow:

The code in try runs first.

If an error happens, JavaScript jumps to catch and runs it.

Whether there was an error or not, the finally block runs in the end.


ii. finally

Even though an error occurred, the finally block always runs.

You use it to clean up resources, like closing files, stopping timers, or disconnecting from a database.

iii. Throwing Custom Errors

You can create your own errors using the throw keyword.

This section covers two main topics:
(i). Conditional Statements: How to make your program make decisions (if, switch).
(ii). Exception Handling: How to deal with errors gracefully (try...catch).

1. Block Statements ({ }) and Scope

Purpose: A block statement is a pair of curly braces { } used to group zero or more JavaScript statements.

Usage: You'll use them constantly with if, else, switch, for, while, etc., to define what code should be run for that condition or loop.

The var "Gotcha": As the note points out, variables declared with var are not block-scoped. They are function-scoped (or global). This means they "leak out" of the block.

Modern Practice: This "leaking" behavior is confusing. That's why let and const were introduced. They are block-scoped, meaning they only exist inside the { } they are defined in. You should almost always prefer let and const.

What is Control Flow?

Control flow determines how your code executes, step by step.
It allows you to make decisions, repeat actions, and handle errors instead of running linearly from top to bottom.
===========================================================================================================================
i. if / else statement

- Used for decision making.
- Executes one block if a condition is true, another if false.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. switch statement

Used to execute different code blocks based on specific values of a variable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iii. for loop

Repeats a block of code a fixed number of times.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iv. while loop

Repeats as long as the condition is true.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v. do...while loop

Runs at least once, even if the condition is false.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vi. break and continue

- break → exits a loop or switch entirely.

- continue → skips current iteration, continues with the next one.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vii. for...in

Used to loop through object properties.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
viii. for...of

Used to loop through arrays or strings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ix. labelled statement (rarely used)

Labels allow you to name a loop and break or continue that specific loop.
